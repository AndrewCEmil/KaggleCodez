Why don't we try extracting a few useful columns and just running it on that?
also used all the data except the first 100k entries

sub1.csv
Useful cols:
    MachineID
    YearMade
    ModelID
    auntioneerID
    MachineHoursCurrentMeter
___

sub2.csv
again without first 100k entries
So I added more columns and ran it with
    MachineID
    YearMade
    ModelID
    auntioneerID
    MachineHoursCurrentMeter
    Turbocharged
    Engine_Horsepower
    ProductGroup
    auctioneerID

AND IT DID WAY WORSE WTF LOL

Ran with the original columns, only 10 trees, but the entire dataset, generated sub3.csv, but still need to submit it
