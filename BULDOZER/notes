Why don't we try extracting a few useful columns and just running it on that?

Useful cols:
    MachineID
    YearMade
    ModelID
    auntioneerID
    MachineHoursCurrentMeter
___

So I added more columns and ran it with
    MachineID
    YearMade
    ModelID
    auntioneerID
    MachineHoursCurrentMeter
    Turbocharged
    Engine_Horsepower
    ProductGroup
    auctioneerID

AND IT DID WAY WORSE WTF LOL
